This file describes the data in the different data files.  
You must create all the tables from the relational model posted
on Canvas.
You only populate the tables that have data in this directory.
So you will have a lot of tables that are not populated.  
Make sure those tables also have constraints specified. 
For foreign keys, you can use any form of cascading you want.
Do not delete columns that I have not provided data for.  Just
set them to allow for NULLs. If one of the tables you have 
data for needs a primary key and I did not provide it, 
you can generate one in postgres using the serial data type
or creating your own sequence.

There is bad data in some of the files.  This was done by
design.  So this is something that you need to deal with.  
You should load all the data into temp tables (possibly 
using different data types for some fields) and then 
you should add only the good data to the final tables. 
You will do that using sql.  If you choose to clean the 
files in linux, you will get some credit for that, but 
less than if you do it in postgres.  I know you can do it 
easily in linux.  I want you to practice doing this in 
postgres using sql.

What do you need to clean:
- Standardize capitalization across fields that need it
- If fields should be numeric, only numeric values should be in the results.
- Emails should have a '@' and a valid domain (e.g. .com or .edu)
- You do not need to clean typos
- You should standarize capitalization if it makes sense. For example, states.
